spark: javascript + HTML5 music player

To build a webpage to play any mp3 reachable from FOO/ simply:

  $ cd FOO/
  $ cp -r /path/to/spark/spark .
  $ cd spark
  $ ./gen-songdb

Now http://your.domain.net/FOO/spark will serve up music under FOO.
(Assuming the prefix up to FOO is already being served.)
